Executing a Command
Use kubectl exec to issue commands in a container or to open a shell in a container.

Receive output from a command run on the first container in a pod:

kubectl exec [pod-name] -- [command]
Get output from a command run on a specific container in a pod:

kubectl exec [pod-name] -c [container-name] -- [command]
Run /bin/bash from a specific pod. The received output comes from the first container:

kubectl exec -ti [pod-name] -- /bin/bash

kubectl exec --stdin --tty <pod name> -- /bin/bash
